CFF
cmap 	character code mapping 	Provides at least one encoding from a stream of bytes to glyphs in the font. FontForge provides at least three encodings in every font (one for Mac Roman, one for Mac Unicode, one for MS Unicode). For some fonts it will additionally provide a CJK encoding (Big5, SJIS, etc) or an extended unicode encoding which will cover code points outside of the BMP.

For fonts with special 1-byte encodings (such as symbol) it will provide a "symbol" encoding which maps a known page in the corporate use area to the glyphs.

gasp 	grid-fitting and scan conversion 	When FontForge does not attempt to hint a truetype font it will generate this table which tells the rasterizer not to to do grid-fitting (hinting) but to do anti-aliasing instead. 	

gasp
	

gasp
GDEF 	glyph definition 	Divides glyphs into various classes that make using the GPOS/GSUB tables easier. Also provides internal caret positions for ligatures. It is approximately equivalent to Apple's 'prop' and 'lcar' tables combined.

loca 	glyph location 	This provides a pointer into the 'glyf' table for each glyph in the font. It is required for truetype and meaningless for opentype (where vaguely equivalent information is provided in the CFF table).

This is a new table (August 2007) and there is currently no publicly available documentation for it.

mort
	

*
morx 	extended metamorphosis 	Provides ligature information, swash, etc. for apple's truetype fonts. FontForge can read and write this table. See the chapter on morx in FontForge for more information. Vaguely equivalent to 'GSUB'.
